➡️ What is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)?

    OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data (properties) and methods (functions).
    Instead of writing code with just functions and variables, you bundle data and behavior together into objects.

    NOTE: The term programming paradigm is used to specify an overall approach to writing program code

➡️ 4 Pillars of OOP:
        1️⃣ Encapsulation
        2️⃣ Abstraction
        3️⃣ Inheritance
        4️⃣ Polymorphism

    1️⃣ Encapsulation:
        Meaning: Wrapping up data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit — a class.
        Goal: Hide the internal details of how an object works and only expose what’s necessary.
        Benefit: Makes code more secure and easier to maintain

    2️⃣ Abstraction:
        Meaning: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.
        Goal: Reduce complexity and allow the programmer to focus on interactions rather than internal logic.
        Benefit: Makes code simpler to understand and use.

    3️⃣ Inheritance:
        Meaning: One class (child) can inherit properties and methods from another class (parent).
        Goal: Promote code reuse.
        Benefit: Avoid duplication and build a hierarchy of classes.
 
    4️⃣ Polymorphism
        Meaning: One interface, many forms. Different classes can define the same method differently.
        Goal: Allow methods to behave differently based on the object.
        Benefit: Makes code flexible and scalable.
