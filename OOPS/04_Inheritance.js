//Inheritance:
/*
Inheritance lets one object acquire the properties and methods of another object. 
In JavaScript this is done by Prototypal Inheritance.
Reusability is the main benefit here. We know sometimes that multiple places need to do the same thing, and 
they need to do everything the same except for one small part. This is a problem inheritance can solve.
