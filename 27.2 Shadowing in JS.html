    <!-- 
        what is shadowing?
        ANS : shadowing occurs when a variable declared in a certain scope (e.g. a local variable) has
             the same name as a variable in an outer scope (e.g. a global variable).
        -->

    <script>
      console.log("shadowing with var");
      var a = 10;
      {
        var a = 20; //this variable 'a' in block shadows the variable 'a' in outside block/global scope
        console.log("var a in block scope= " + a); //20
        // this variables value comes from line number 18 and not from line number 16. This is known as shadowing
      }
      console.log("global var a= " + a); // prints 20 again , So value of 'a' modifies the value of varibale 'a'
      // which is declared outside the block. Because they both pointing to the
      // same memory location (watch at 9:28)
      // and they both are in the gobal object(same memory space)

      // lets try this with let
      console.log("Shadowing with let");
      let b = 5; // this b is in script scope
      {
        let b = 10; // this b is in block scope
        console.log("inside block: let b= " + b); // 10 , this refers to the block scope
      }
      console.log("outside block: let b= " + b); // 5 , this refers to the script scope
      // so, nothing changed here , Because both b's are different in block and outside the block
      // The both b's have different scope , they both have different memory space
      // and this is known as shadowing (same thing also happens with const let's try:)

      // lets try this with const
      console.log("Shadowing with const");

      const c = 40;
      {
        const c = 80;
        console.log("inside block: const c= " + c); // 80
      }
      console.log("outside block: const c= " + c); // 40
      // so we have same o/p here like we have in let .Same thing happens here as well
      // they both are coming from different memory space/scope

      //shadowing behaves same way in functions as well
      console.log("Shadowing in functions:");
      var x = 2;
      let y = 3;
      const z = 4;
      shadowing();
      function shadowing() {
        var x = 12;
        console.log("var x= " + x); // 12
        let y = 13;
        console.log("let y= " + y); // 13
        const z = 14;
        console.log("const z= " + z); // 14
      }
      console.log("Now they are outside the function:");
      console.log("var x= " + x); // 2 (here in functions var  have have different memory space inside and outside the functions so, will have different o/p here as compared to a in block)
      console.log("let y= " + y); // 3
      console.log("const z= " + z); // 4
