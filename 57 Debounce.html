      ->What is Debounce in Javascript?
      ->Debouncing is a programming pattern or a technique to restrict the calling of a time-consuming
          function frequently, by delaying the execution of the function until a specified time
          to avoid unnecessary CPU cycles, and API calls and improve performance.

      ->Explanation:
          in our example we have input element imagine,search movie name inside and database and you
          want to list of all movies with name MATRIX , and it gives you list, When you type each character
          its going to set the brand new request, so when i type M its going to search for all
          movie starting with M, so when i type MA its going to search all movies with MA, then so on..
          And for searching MATRIX we made 6 requests to server which will cause performace issue, slows down process
          to over come this "Debouncing and Throttle comes"
          (->Debounce and throttle have different ways of working)
          ->They are the ways to actually slow down a function call, instead of calling a function every time
          its only going to call a function after a set delay.
          ->Debounce : instead of calling every single time, instead what debounce does is that, it does
          hey has there been a delay since last time you called the function.
          so when i type M it waits(say 1 second) before calling the function as long as nothing changes in
          1 second then function runs, but during that 1 second i type another character say A, its
          going to say something has changed reset our timer back to 1s and wait to see if anything
          has changed so, if type another charatcer it resets timer and waits and if nothing changes
          then function runs
          ->so Debounce waits until there's been atleast a set period of time in our case 1 second
             before actually calls the function , now in code watch at 3:18

        defaultText.textContent = e.target.value;

      //debounce
      //it calls this callback function cb after delay as long as we haven't
      //recalled debounce in the past
      //we give debounce a function inside it
      function debounce(cb, delay = 1000) { //cb = callback
        //debounce returns us a function
        let timeout;
        return (...args) => {
          clearTimeout(timeout); // resetting timer
          timeout=setTimeout(() => {
            cb(...args);
          }, delay); //so its forcing our function to wait 1 second before it runs
        };
      }
      //important watch at: 5:05
      //debounce makes sure you make one request after everything has changed
