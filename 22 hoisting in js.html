         // 02) here we are trying to access variables and functions before declearing them .
                    //this will not work in most programming languages
            //getName(); // will give result
            //console.log(x); // will show undefined or no result and if we remove var x=7;
            // it wil show not defined in error
            // javascript was somehow able to get the function but not variable
            

            // console.log(getName); 
            //it will print the function itself i.e whole code of the function


            var x=7;
            function getName(){
                console.log("Hoisting in JAVASCRIPT");
            }
            //4) : for debugging watch at 7:00
            getName();
            console.log(x);
            console.log(getName);    

        /* 1)   getName(); 
            console.log(x);*/
            // using them here will print results , now lets try them at top

           // 3)
            // it will print the function itself i.e whole code of the function
            console.log(getName);
           // if you write this command before the function it will still print the function
