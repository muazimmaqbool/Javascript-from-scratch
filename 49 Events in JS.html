            Events: HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
                   When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.
            events can be : click,scolling, changing, hover etc
         For example:
         if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to react to that action by displaying an information box
        -> An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.
                Here are some examples of HTML events:
                    An HTML web page has finished loading
                    An HTML input field was changed
                    An HTML button was clicked
        -->
        <!-- Example-1 (the JavaScript code changes the content of the element with id="demo")-->
        <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML=Date()">The time is?</button>
        <p id="demo"></p>

        <!-- Example-2( the code changes the content of its own element (using this.innerHTML)) -->
        <button onclick="this.innerHTML=Date()">Get Time</button>

        <!-- Example-3-->
        <button onclick="displayDate()">The time is?</button>
        <p id="demo1"></p>
        
        <!--Example-4-->
        <div onmouseover="this.style.backgroundColor='green'">myDIV.</div>
        <div id="div2" onmouseout="this.style.backgroundColor='blue'">Div2</div>
        <script>
            function displayDate() {
                document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = Date();
            }
        </script>
