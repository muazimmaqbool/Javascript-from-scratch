->Queue Data Structure:
 A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. 
 This means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed, similar to a line of people waiting for a service. 
 A Queue is like a line at a coffee shop â€” first person in line gets served first.
