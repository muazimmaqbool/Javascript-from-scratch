->Stack Data Structure:
    A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. 
    This means the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. 
    Imagine a stack of plates: you can only add a new plate to the top, and you can only remove the top plate. 

    Stack Operations:
    | Operation   | Description             |
    | ----------- | ----------------------- |
    | `push()`    | Add an item on top      |
    | `pop()`     | Remove the top item     |
    | `peek()`    | View the top item       |
    | `isEmpty()` | Check if stack is empty |
    | `size()`    | Get number of items     |
