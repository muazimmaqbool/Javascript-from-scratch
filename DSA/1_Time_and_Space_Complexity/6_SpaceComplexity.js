/* 
Space Complexity: it's basically an amount of memoty an algorithm needs to run and it's also measured in big O notation
space and memory is basically the memory taken by the variables which are decalred like strings, array , int etc and that's exactly
what space compelxity is,
So, basically as the input size increases so does the soace complexity and keep in mind it's not always about the size of input but
also the size of the algorithm and any other additional data structure if used
