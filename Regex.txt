->What is Regex?
    In JavaScript, a Regular Expression (Regex or RegExp) is a powerful, built-in object used to define a search pattern for matching, searching, and manipulating text strings. 
    These patterns, which use a combination of literal and special characters, are used for tasks like input validation, data extraction, and text replacement. 

->How to READ regex (the real skill)?
    Always follow this mental process:

    Step 1: Ignore slashes
    /\s+/ → \s+

    Step 2: Translate left to right
    Ask:
    What does this match?
    How many times?

->How to WRITE regex (simple method):
    Method: Write in English first:
      1. Goal: “Split by spaces” 
            English → “One or more spaces”
            Regex → \s+

      2. Goal: “Remove everything except letters”:
            English → “NOT a-z”
            Regex → [^a-z]

      3. Goal: “Only digits”:
            English → “One or more digits”
            Regex → \d+
