->What is Regex?
    In JavaScript, a Regular Expression (Regex or RegExp) is a powerful, built-in object used to define a search pattern for matching, searching, and manipulating text strings. 
    These patterns, which use a combination of literal and special characters, are used for tasks like input validation, data extraction, and text replacement. 

->How to READ regex (the real skill)?

    Step 2: Translate left to right
    Ask:
    What does this match?
    How many times?
