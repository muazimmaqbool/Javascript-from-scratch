->What is Regex?
    In JavaScript, a Regular Expression (Regex or RegExp) is a powerful, built-in object used to define a search pattern for matching, searching, and manipulating text strings. 
    These patterns, which use a combination of literal and special characters, are used for tasks like input validation, data extraction, and text replacement. 

->How to READ regex (the real skill)?
    Always follow this mental process:

    Step 1: Ignore slashes
    /\s+/ → \s+

    Step 2: Translate left to right
    Ask:
    What does this match?
    How many times?

            | `$`    | end             |
            | `g`    | global          |

->How to WRITE regex (simple method):
    Method: Write in English first:
      1. Goal: “Split by spaces” 
            English → “One or more spaces”
            Regex → \s+

      2. Goal: “Remove everything except letters”:
            English → “NOT a-z”
            Regex → [^a-z]

      3. Goal: “Only digits”:
            English → “One or more digits”
            Regex → \d+

->Debugging Trick (Very Powerful):
    Use this site: 👉 https://regex101.com
    After visting the above mentioned website type this: /[^a-z]/g
    It visually shows:
        What matches
        Why it matches
        Step-by-step
        Every senior dev uses this.

->How Seniors Actually Use Regex (Reality):
    No one memorizes all of it.
    Real workflow:
        Describe in English
        Google: “regex remove non letters”
        Test on regex101
        Adjust
    That’s it.

->Two Examples in Plain English:
    /\s+/ Match one or more spaces
    /[^a-z]/g  Match everything that is not a letter, globally

->Interview One-Liner (Gold):
    Regex is a pattern-matching language; I read it left to right by translating each symbol into plain English.

->Final Mindset Shift (Important)
    Don't think:
    ❌ "I need to memorize regex"

    Think:
    ✅ "I need to learn how to read regex"

->Once you can read:
    Writing becomes trivial.
