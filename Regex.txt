->What is Regex?
    In JavaScript, a Regular Expression (Regex or RegExp) is a powerful, built-in object used to define a search pattern for matching, searching, and manipulating text strings. 
    These patterns, which use a combination of literal and special characters, are used for tasks like input validation, data extraction, and text replacement.
