        In JavaScript, objects are king. If you understand objects, you understand JavaScript.

        In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

        Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
        Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
        Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
        Dates are always objects
        Maths are always objects
        Regular expressions are always objects
        Arrays are always objects
        Functions are always objects
        Objects are always objects
        -> All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.

        JavaScript Primitives
        A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.

        3.14 is a primitive value

        A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.

        JavaScript defines 7 types of primitive data types:

        Examples
        string
        number
        boolean
        null
        undefined
        symbol
        bigint
        Immutable
        Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and cannot be changed).

        if x = 3.14, you can change the value of x, but you cannot change the value of 3.14.

        Value	Type	Comment
        "Hello"	string	"Hello" is always "Hello"
        3.14	number	3.14 is always 3.14
        true	boolean	true is always true
        false	boolean	false is always false
        null	null (object)	null is always null
        undefined	undefined	undefined is always undefined
