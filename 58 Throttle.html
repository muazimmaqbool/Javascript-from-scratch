      /* debounce on previous code (throttle is little bit different then debounce)
     -> throtle works where it delay your function call but instead of waiting until everything is done
     what throttle does is it says okay as soon as you make a change i'm going to send off a request
     and then every single second if that's your delay i'm going to continually send a new request based
     on whatevery the last input was, watch at 7:15
     so, throttling limits the rate at which function is called, its useful when dealing with events
     that may triggered many times in a short period of time or making server requests that should
     not be sent too frequently

     ->Debounce is more useful for control events like typing or button clicks
     ->Throttle is mot suitable for continuous user events like resizing and scrolling
     -> debounce waits until there has been some time delay before it runs
     -> throttle runs immediately when you call the function
