    <!--
        A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
        A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
        A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
        
        Functions also help in keeping the code more updatable and more organise
    
        Why Functions?
            You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
            You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.
