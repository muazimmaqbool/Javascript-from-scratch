       Note:{
       call back functions in js is already studied in previous code 34 , here i'm making it simple to
       understand beter }

      //What are Callbacks in JavaScript?
      //ANS: A callback is a function that is passed inside another function, and then called in that function to perform a task.

      //Confusing? Let's break it down by practically implementing it.
      console.log("Displayed first");
      console.log("Displayed second");
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Displayed third");
      }, 3000);
      console.log("Displayed last"); // will be displayed after second and before third as third is displayed 3 seconds later

      //Explanation:
      /*
        -> The setTimeout is a JavaScript function that takes two parameters. The first parameter is another
         function, and the second is the time after which that function should be executed in milliseconds.
          Now you see the definition of callbacks coming into play.

        -> You see that the last instruction is logged before the function in the setTimeout returns 
        its result. Say we used this method to fetch data from a database. While the user is waiting
        for the database call to return results, the flow in execution will not be interrupted.

        ->This method was very efficient, but only to a certain point. Sometimes, developers have to 
        make multiple calls to different sources in their code. In order to make these calls,
         callbacks are being nested until they become very hard to read or maintain. 
         This is referred to as Callback Hell
        
        -> To fix this problem, promises were introduced.

        -> Where callbacks really shine are in asynchronous functions, where one function has to wait 
         for another function (like waiting for a file to load).
