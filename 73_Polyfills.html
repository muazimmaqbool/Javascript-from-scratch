        A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality
        on older browsers that do not natively support it.

        In simple terms: Polyfills in JavaScript are pieces of code that provide modern functionality to older browsers
                         that lack native support for those features. 
                         They bridge the gap between the JavaScript language features and APIs available in modern browsers
                         and the limited capabilities of older browser versions.

        For example, a polyfill could be used to mimic the functionality of a text-shadow in IE7 
        using proprietary IE filters, or mimic rem units or media queries by using JavaScript 
        to dynamically adjust the styling as appropriate, or whatever else you require.

        The reason why polyfills are not used exclusively is for better functionality and better performance. 
        Native implementations of APIs can do more and are faster than polyfills. 
        For example, the Object.create polyfill only contains the functionalities that are possible 
        in a non-native implementation of Object.create.
