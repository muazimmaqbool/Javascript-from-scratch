            Different Kinds of Loops
            JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
            for - loops through a block of code a number of times
            for/in - loops through the properties of an object
            for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
            while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
            do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
