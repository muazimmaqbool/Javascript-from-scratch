->REST:
    REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architecture style — a set of principles/rules for designing networked systems.
    It defines concepts like:
        Client–Server
        Statelessness
        Resources
        Uniform interface
        Cacheability

    REST is not an API, it’s a way of thinking about how APIs should be built.
