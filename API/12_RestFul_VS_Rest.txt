->REST:
    REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architecture style — a set of principles/rules for designing networked systems.
    It defines concepts like:
        Client–Server
        Statelessness
        Resources
        Uniform interface
        Cacheability

    REST is not an API, it’s a way of thinking about how APIs should be built.

->REST API:
    A REST API is an actual implementation of those REST principles.

    In simple words:
    A REST API is an API that follows REST rules.

    Example:
        GET /users/1
        POST /users
        PUT /users/1
        DELETE /users/1

->RESTFul:
    RESTful is just an adjective.

    It means:
    "This API follows REST principles properly."

    So when someone says:
    “This is a RESTful API”

    They mean:
    “This API is designed according to REST.”

->Real difference (one-liner):
    | Term     | Meaning                                        |
    | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
    | REST     | The **theory / architecture style**            |
    | REST API | The **actual API built using REST**            |
    | RESTful  | A **quality label** (how well it follows REST) |

->Practical developer view:
    REST → Rulebook
    REST API → Your backend endpoints
    RESTful → How clean/well-designed your API is

->Common mistake (important)
    Many so-called “REST APIs” are actually not fully RESTful.

    ->Example (not RESTful):
        POST /getUser
        POST /deleteUser

    ->Proper RESTful version:
        GET /users/1
        DELETE /users/1

->In short:
    There is no real technical difference between RESTful API and REST API in daily usage.
    REST = concept
    REST API = implementation
    RESTful = compliance level
    That’s it.
