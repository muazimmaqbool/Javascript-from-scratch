        //it returns data we send also an id : in this case its : 101 means the data we send to server
        //is added to this number (its an response from the server)
        //initally in this file there was 100 records and we added new recorde and which is added at 101

        //here its not saved permentally on this file as this is fake file its juts for understanding purpose
        //but if we have used our own server path/file then it will save it permentally , working flow is same
