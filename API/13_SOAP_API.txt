->What is SOAP?
    SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured data between systems.
    Unlike REST (which is a style), SOAP is a strict standard.
    One-liner (interview)
    SOAP is a protocol that uses XML for communication and follows strict rules defined by a formal specification.


Key characteristics:

1. Uses only XML:
    SOAP messages are always XML.

    Example:
        <soap:Envelope>
        <soap:Body>
            <GetUser>
            <id>1</id>
            </GetUser>
        </soap:Body>
        </soap:Envelope>
    No JSON, no flexibility.

2. Has a WSDL (contract):
    SOAP APIs come with a WSDL file:
    Web Services Description Language

    It defines:
        Available methods
        Input/output types
        Endpoint URLs
        So client and server are strongly typed.

3. Transport independent:
    SOAP can work over:
        HTTP
        SMTP
        TCP
        JMS
    (Not limited to HTTP like REST usually is)

4. Built-in standards:
    SOAP supports:
        Security (WS-Security)
        Transactions
        Reliability
        Error handling

->REST vs SOAP (core differences):
    | Feature        | REST               | SOAP             |
    | -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
    | Nature         | Architecture style | Protocol         |
    | Data format    | Usually JSON       | Always XML       |
    | Contract       | Optional           | Mandatory (WSDL) |
    | Flexibility    | High               | Low (strict)     |
    | Performance    | Fast, lightweight  | Slower, heavy    |
    | Learning curve | Easy               | Steep            |

->When SOAP is used (real world):
SOAP is still common in:
    Banking systems
    Payment gateways
    Enterprise systems
    Government services

Because they need:
    Strong security
    Formal contracts
    Guaranteed delivery
