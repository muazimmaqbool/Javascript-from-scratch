->What is SOAP?
    SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured data between systems.
    Unlike REST (which is a style), SOAP is a strict standard.
    One-liner (interview)
    SOAP is a protocol that uses XML for communication and follows strict rules defined by a formal specification.


Key characteristics:

1. Uses only XML:
    SOAP messages are always XML.

    Example:
        <soap:Envelope>
            <soap:Body>
                <GetUser>
                <id>1</id>
                </GetUser>
            </soap:Body>
        </soap:Envelope>
    No JSON, no flexibility.

2. Has a WSDL (contract):
    SOAP APIs come with a WSDL file:
    Web Services Description Language

    It defines:
        Available methods
        Input/output types
        Endpoint URLs
        So client and server are strongly typed.

3. Transport independent:
    SOAP can work over:
        HTTP
        SMTP
        TCP
        JMS
    (Not limited to HTTP like REST usually is)

4. Built-in standards:
    SOAP supports:
        Security (WS-Security)
        Transactions
        Reliability
        Error handling

->REST vs SOAP (core differences):
    | Feature        | REST               | SOAP             |
    | -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
    | Nature         | Architecture style | Protocol         |
    | Data format    | Usually JSON       | Always XML       |
    | Contract       | Optional           | Mandatory (WSDL) |
    | Flexibility    | High               | Low (strict)     |
    | Performance    | Fast, lightweight  | Slower, heavy    |
    | Learning curve | Easy               | Steep            |

->When SOAP is used (real world):
    SOAP is still common in:
        Banking systems
        Payment gateways
        Enterprise systems
        Government services

    Because they need:
        Strong security
        Formal contracts
        Guaranteed delivery

->Typical interview Q&A:

    Q: Why is SOAP considered heavy?
    Answer:
    Because it uses verbose XML, strict schemas, and large message sizes.

    Q: Can SOAP use JSON?
    Answer:
    No. SOAP strictly uses XML.

    Q: Does SOAP support REST principles?
    Answer:
    No. SOAP is completely different and does not follow REST concepts.

    Mental model (easy to remember)
        REST = Casual conversation
        SOAP = Legal contract meeting

    REST is flexible.
    SOAP is formal and strict.

    In short (perfect summary):
    SOAP is a strict, XML-based protocol with built-in standards for security and reliability, mainly used in enterprise-level systems.
