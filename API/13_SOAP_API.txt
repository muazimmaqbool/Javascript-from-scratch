->What is SOAP?
    SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured data between systems.
    Unlike REST (which is a style), SOAP is a strict standard.
    One-liner (interview)
    SOAP is a protocol that uses XML for communication and follows strict rules defined by a formal specification.


Key characteristics:

1. Uses only XML:
    SOAP messages are always XML.

    Example:
        <soap:Envelope>
        <soap:Body>
            <GetUser>
            <id>1</id>
            </GetUser>
        </soap:Body>
        </soap:Envelope>
    No JSON, no flexibility.

2. Has a WSDL (contract):
    SOAP APIs come with a WSDL file:
    Web Services Description Language
    
    It defines:
        Available methods
        Input/output types
        Endpoint URLs
        So client and server are strongly typed.
