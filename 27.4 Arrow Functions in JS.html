        Important : All the scope rules that applied on functions are same with Arrow Functions as well
        ->Arrow function is one of the features introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript. 
              It allows you to create functions in a cleaner way compared to regular functions.
               For example:
                                 // function expression
                                  let x = function(x, y) {
                                 return x * y;
                                  }
                                 can be written as:
                                 // using arrow functions
                                  let x = (x, y) => x * y;
                                using an arrow function.

        ->The syntax of the arrow function is:
                let myFunction = (arg1, arg2, ...argN) => {
                    statement(s)
                }
                Here,
        - myFunction is the name of the function
        - arg1, arg2, ...argN are the function arguments
        - statement(s) is the function body
        - If the body has single statement or expression, you can write arrow function as:
                let myFunction = (arg1, arg2, ...argN) => expression

        ->Uses of Arrow functions:
            Arrow functions introduce concise body syntax, or implicit return. This allows the omission 
            of the curly brackets and the return keyword. Implicit return is useful for creating 
            succinct one-line operations in map , filter , and other common array methods.
