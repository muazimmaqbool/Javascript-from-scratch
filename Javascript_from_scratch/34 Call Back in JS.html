        A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function
        This technique allows a function to call another function
        A callback function can run after another function has finished Execution

                Suppose you want to do a calculation, and then display the result.
                You could call a calculator function (myCalculator), save the result, 
                and then call another function (myDisplayer) to display the result:

                Example
                function myDisplayer(some) {
                  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = some;
                }

                function myCalculator(num1, num2) {
                  let sum = num1 + num2;
                  return sum;
                }

                let result = myCalculator(5, 5);
                myDisplayer(result);

                Or, you could call a calculator function (myCalculator), and
                 let the calculator function calls the display function (myDisplayer):

                Example
                function myDisplayer(some) {
                  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = some;
                }

                function myCalculator(num1, num2) {
                  let sum = num1 + num2;
                  myDisplayer(sum);
                }

                myCalculator(5, 5);

                ->The problem with the first example, is that you have to call two functions to display the result.

                ->The problem with the second example, is that you cannot prevent the calculator function from displaying the result.
              */

               //Now it is time to bring in a callback.
              /* JavaScript Callbacks:
                A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.
                Using a callback, you could call the calculator function (myCalculator) with a callback,
                 and let the calculator function run the callback after the calculation is finished:*/
                
                 function result(text){
                    document.getElementById("SUM").innerHTML=text;
                 }
                 function calculator(num1, num2, callback){ //callback can be any name
                    let sum=num1+num2;
                    callback(sum); // in callback we have result function
                 }
                 calculator(6,7,result); // result function is passed as argument to the calculator function

                 /* When you pass a function as an argument, remember not to use parenthesis.
                    Right: myCalculator(5, 5, myDisplayer);
                    Wrong: myCalculator(5, 5, myDisplayer()); */

        <!-- When to Use a Callback?
        The examples above are not very exciting.
        
        They are simplified to teach you the callback syntax.
        
        Where callbacks really shines are in asynchronous functions, where one function has to wait for another
         function (like waiting for a file to load).       
        Asynchronous functions are covered in the next program. -->
