            (reduce is important)(11:36)
        
        -> reduce() function is basically at a place were you have to take all the elements of an array
                    and come-up with a single value out of them
        ->The reduce() method reduces an array of values down to just one value. 
        ->To get the output value, it runs a reducer function on each element of the array.
            Syntax
                arr.reduce(callback, initialValue)
                The callback argument is a function that will be called once for every element in the array. 
                This function takes four arguments, but often only the first two are used.

                accumulator - the returned value of the previous iteration
                currentValue - the current item in the array
                index - the index of the current item
                array - the original array on which reduce was called

                The initialValue argument is optional. If provided, it will be used as the initial 
                accumulator value in the first call to the callback function.
        
        -> suppose you want to iterate through the elements of an array and find out the sum or
          find out the largest/smallest among them reduce is used

        <script>
            const arr=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
            //find sum of array
            //without reduce() function
            function sumArray(arr){
                let sum=0;
                for(var i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
                    sum=sum+arr[i];
                }
                return sum;
            }
           console.log("sum:",sumArray(arr)) // o/p: 45
           
           //finding the sum of arr array with reduce() function
           const output=arr.reduce(function(acc,curr){
            // console.log("curr:",curr)
                acc=acc+curr;
                return acc;
           },0); // here if we don't give it initial value as zero it will still use 0 value for acc as initial value
           console.log("with reduce(), sum: "+output); // o/p: 45
           //explanation: 
           /*
            acc(accumulator): this is used to accumulate the values/result
            curr(current): represents the value when we are iterating(every element) {i.e curr will be array element}
            here: acc is in place of sum(line no.34) and curr is in place of arr[i]
            so in previous method to get sum we do: sum=sum+arr[i] now, we will do like this: acc=acc+curr 
            but we need to initialize the first value for the first go like we do sum=0(line 34), here
            also the function takes second argument as index(initial value), we set it to 0 i.e acc will be 0 in first go   
            so, the reduce funtion takes first argument function and second argument is any initial value
