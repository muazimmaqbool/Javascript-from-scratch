    Hoisting in js: Hoisting in js is the phenomenon by which you can access the variables and functions
    before initializing them, or before you put some value in them. You can access them without any errors

            // 02) here we are trying to access variables and functions before declearing them .
            //this will not work in most programming languages
            //getName(); // will give result
           // console.log(x); // will show undefined or no result and if we remove var x=7;
            // it wil show not "x is not defined" in error (i.e it will give reference error)
            // javascript was somehow able to get the function but not the variable
            

            //console.log(getName); 
            //it will print the function itself i.e whole code of the function


            var x=7;
            function getName(){
                console.log("Hoisting in JAVASCRIPT");
            }

            //  01)
            //  getName(); 
            //  console.log(x);
            // using them here will print results , now lets try them at top

           // 3)
            // it will print the function itself i.e whole code of the function
            //console.log(getName);
           // if you write this command before the function it will still print the function
