            // o/p like this ["Muazim Maqbool","Danish Gul",...]
            //-> the of power these function is that you can chain them/combine them (watch at 33:55)
            //->
            //using only filter (this will o/p whole details of those with less than 40 marks but want only their name)
             //const stds1=students.filter(x=>x.marks<40)

            //this map() with filter() works on/with the output of the filter function so we get name 
            //and marks of only those whos marks are less than 40.
            // with filter() we got only those with marks<40 and with map we got their name and marks

            //can do above task with reduce() now this is a task , lets try it!

            },[]); // using {} here will show error, because if we use {} then we can't use acc.push
            console.log(output);

            //Note:
            //You can chain the reduce() after map() and filter() as they return an array but can't chain map() and filter() on reduce as it returns a single value.
