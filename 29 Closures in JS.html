        study closures from: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_closures.asp" target="_blank">W3 Schools<br></a>
        And from N.S youtube video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qikxEIxsXco&list=PLlasXeu85E9cQ32gLCvAvr9vNaUccPVNP&index=12" target="_blank">Youtube</a>

        <!--
        -> A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its 
            surrounding state (the lexical environment). 
            In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function
        
        -> JavaScript variables can belong to the local or global scope.
           Global variables can be made local (private) with closures.

        (global variables belong to the page. Global variables can be used (and changed) by all other scripts in the page.)
        (A local variable can only be used inside the function where it is defined. It is hidden from other functions and other scripting code.)    
        (Global and local variables with the same name are different variables. Modifying one, does not modify the other.)
        (Variables created without a declaration keyword (var, let, or const) are always global, even if they are created inside a function.)

        What is meant by lexical scope?
        ANS: Lexical scope is the ability for a function scope to access variables from the parent scope.

        <script>
            //from N.S video
            function x(){
                var a=10;
                function y(){
                    console.log(a); // will print a , because of lexical scope, it will first look 'a' in 
                //its local memory space and then in its parent functions memory space, and that's what
                // closure is . now see in code 29.1 Closures in js
                }
                y();
            }
            x();
