        ->Functional Programming Paradigm:
            Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions. 
            It is a declarative style. Its main focus is on “what to solve,” in contrast to an imperative style, 
            where the main focus is on “how to solve.” It uses expressions instead of statements.
            An expression is evaluated to produce a value, whereas a statement is executed to assign variables. 
            Those functions have some special features discussed below.
