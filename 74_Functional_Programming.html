        ->Functional Programming Paradigm:
            Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions. 
            It is a declarative style. Its main focus is on “what to solve,” in contrast to an imperative style, 
            where the main focus is on “how to solve.” It uses expressions instead of statements.
            An expression is evaluated to produce a value, whereas a statement is executed to assign variables. 
            Those functions have some special features discussed below.

            In simple terms:
             Functional programming is a way of writing code where you focus on functions to process data. 
             It avoids changing variables (no side effects) and works with immutable data. 
             Functions in this style are treated like reusable tools.

            Why use functional programming?
             Easier to understand: Code is cleaner and easier to read.
             Fewer bugs: Avoiding side effects makes programs more predictable.
             Reusable code: Functions can be reused in different parts of your program.

        ->What is Functional Programming?
            Lambda calculus is a framework developed by Alonzo Church to study computations with functions. 
            It can be called the smallest programming language in the world. It defines what is computable. 
            Anything that can be computed by lambda calculus is computable. 
            It is equivalent to a Turing machine in its ability to compute.
            It provides a theoretical framework for describing functions and their evaluation. 
            It forms the basis of almost all current functional programming languages. 
            
            Fact: Alan Turing was a student of Alonzo Church who created Turing machine which laid the foundation of
                 imperative programming style. 
        
        ->Programming Languages that support functional programming: 
               Haskell, JavaScript, Python, Scala, Erlang, Lisp, ML, Clojure, OCaml, Common Lisp, Racket.

        ->Concepts of Functional Programming:
            Pure functions
            Recursion
            Referential transparency
            Functions are First-Class and can be Higher-Order
            Variables are Immutable
