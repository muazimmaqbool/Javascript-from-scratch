        ->Functional Programming Paradigm:
            Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions. 
            It is a declarative style. Its main focus is on “what to solve,” in contrast to an imperative style, 
            where the main focus is on “how to solve.” It uses expressions instead of statements.
            An expression is evaluated to produce a value, whereas a statement is executed to assign variables. 
            Those functions have some special features discussed below. 

        {
            In simple terms:
             Functional programming is a way of writing code where you focus on functions to process data. 
             It avoids changing variables (no side effects) and works with immutable data. 
             Functions in this style are treated like reusable tools.

            Why use functional programming?
             Easier to understand: Code is cleaner and easier to read.
             Fewer bugs: Avoiding side effects makes programs more predictable.
             Reusable code: Functions can be reused in different parts of your program.

            Example (in JavaScript):
                const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
                const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
                console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

             Here, instead of manually looping through numbers and changing values, map is used to create a new array
             with the values doubled. No variables are changed.
    
            Functional programming is often used in data processing, handling streams of data, and tasks where predictable
            results are crucial, like in AI or finance.

        ->What is Functional Programming?
            Lambda calculus is a framework developed by Alonzo Church to study computations with functions. 
            It can be called the smallest programming language in the world. It defines what is computable. 
            Anything that can be computed by lambda calculus is computable. 
            It is equivalent to a Turing machine in its ability to compute.
            It provides a theoretical framework for describing functions and their evaluation. 
            It forms the basis of almost all current functional programming languages. 
            
            Fact: Alan Turing was a student of Alonzo Church who created Turing machine which laid the foundation of
                 imperative programming style. 
        
        ->Programming Languages that support functional programming: 
               Haskell, JavaScript, Python, Scala, Erlang, Lisp, ML, Clojure, OCaml, Common Lisp, Racket.

        ->Concepts of Functional Programming:
            Pure functions
            Recursion
            Referential transparency
            Functions are First-Class and can be Higher-Order
            Variables are Immutable

        1)Pure Functions:
            These functions have two main properties. First, they always produce the same output for same arguments
                             irrespective of anything else. 
            Secondly, they have no side-effects i.e. they do not modify any arguments or local/global variables or input/output streams. 
            Later property is called immutability. The pure function’s only result is the value it returns. They are deterministic. 
            Programs done using functional programming are easy to debug because pure functions have no side 
            effects or hidden I/O. Pure functions also make it easier to write parallel/concurrent applications.
            When the code is written in this style, a smart compiler can do many things – it can parallelize the instructions, 
            wait to evaluate results when needing them, and memorize the results since the results never change as 
            long as the input doesn’t change. 

            -Example of the Pure Function:
            sum(x, y)           // sum is function taking x and y as arguments
                return x + y  
                
        2)Recursion:
            There are no “for” or “while” loop in functional languages. Iteration in functional languages is
            implemented through recursion. 
            Recursive functions repeatedly call themselves, until it reaches the base case. 

            -Example of the recursive function:   
            fib(n)
                if (n <= 1)
                    return 1;
                else
                    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);

        3)Referential Transparency:
            In functional programs variables once defined do not change their value throughout the program. 
            Functional programs do not have assignment statements. If we have to store some value, we define new variables instead. 
            This eliminates any chances of side effects because any variable can be replaced with its actual value 
            at any point of execution. State of any variable is constant at any instant. 
            
            Example:  
            
            x = x + 1 // this changes the value assigned to the variable x.
                    // So the expression is not referentially transparent. 

        4)Functions are First-Class and can be Higher-Order:
            First-class functions are treated as first-class variable. The first class variables can be passed to functions
            as parameter, can be returned from functions or stored in data structures. Higher order functions are the functions 
            that take other functions as arguments and they can also return functions. 
            
            Example: 
            show_output(f)            // function show_output is declared taking argument f 
                          // which are another function
                f();                  // calling passed function

            print_gfg()             // declaring another function 
                print("hello gfg");

            show_output(print_gfg)
