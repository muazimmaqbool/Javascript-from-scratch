        ->This Program contains intro of map() filter() and reduce() in JS
        
        ->map() filter() and reduce(): are higher order functions in JS
         Note: {higher order functions: a function which takes another function as an argument or 
                returns a function is known as a higher order function}
        
        ->Map, reduce, and filter are all array methods in JavaScript. Each one will iterate 
        over an array and perform a transformation or computation. Each will return a new array 
        based on the result of the function. 
        
      Important:->The map(), reduce() and filter() are array functions that transform the array according 
      to the applied function and return the updated array. They are used to write simple, 
       short and clean codes for modifying an array instead of using the loops.
