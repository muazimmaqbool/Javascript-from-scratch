        <!--
        Block: A block statement is used to group zero or more statements. The block is delimited 
               by a pair of braces ("curly brackets") and contains a list of zero or more statements 
               and declarations.
               {
                //block 
               }
               *** Block is also known as "compound statement" ****

               Block is used to combine multiple statements into one group
               eg.
               {
                var a=10;
                console.log(a);
               } // this block is combining multiple js statements into one group

            *** why we group multiple statements ?
            ANS : we group multiple statements together in a block so that we can use it where JS expects
            one statement (watch at 2:00 from N.S)

            exmple:
            if(true) and run this code it will show error because if expects one statements 
            -> if(true)true : runs perfectly because we give it true as one statements.
            but if you want to write multiple statements after if. You can only do that by grouping them
            together via block eg: if(true){
                                            }

                we can also write like this for only one statement: if(true)console.log("hi");
                but for multiple statemts we need to use block example in script elements

                What is Block Scope?
                ANS: Block Scope means what variable and fuctions we can access inside this block
                i.e known as block scope example in code.

        <script>
            if(true){
                var a=5;
                console.log(a);
            }

            //if(true)console.log("hi"); //runs perfectly

            //block scope example at 5:00
            console.log('inside block')
            {
                var b=10;
                let c=20;  
                const d=30;
                // let are const can't be accessed outside the block but var can be
                console.log("var: ",b); // 10
                console.log("let: ",c); //20
                console.log("const: ",d); //30
            }
            console.log('outside block')
            console.log("var: ",b); //10
            //console.log("let: ",c); //error 
            //console.log("const: ",d); //error
