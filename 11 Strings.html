            JavaScript strings are for storing and manipulating text.
            A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.
            let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";  // Double quotes
            let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';  // Single quotes

        -> You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:
            Example:
            let answer1 = "It's alright";
            let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
            let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';
        -->

        <script>
            let answer1 = "It's alright";
            console.log(answer1);
            let answer2 = "He is called 'Hacker'";
            console.log(answer2);

            //String Length
            let text = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
            let length = text.length;
            console.log(length);
            let words="Hey how are you! doing today" //space and special characters are also counted
            console.log(words.length);

            //Escape Character
            /*The backslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string characters:
                   Code	 Result	    Description
                    \'	   '	    Single quote
                    \"	   "	    Double quote
                    \\	   \	    Backslash    */
            //let text1="I am using "Hp" laptop with 8GB of RAM"; //error
            let text1="I am using \"Hp\" laptop with 8GB of RAM";
            console.log(text1);

            //Six other escape sequences are valid in JavaScript:
           /*   Code	Result
                \b	  Backspace
                \f	  Form Feed
                \n	  New Line
                \r	  Carriage Return
                \t	  Horizontal Tabulator
                \v	  Vertical Tabulator 
            NOTE: The 6 escape characters above were originally designed to control typewriters,
                 teletypes, and fax machines. They do not make any sense in HTML.

            //JavaScript Strings as Objects
          /*  Normally, JavaScript strings are primitive values, created from literals:
                    let x = "John";
                    But strings can also be defined as objects with the keyword new:
                    let y = new String("John");*/

                    //Example
                    // x is a string
                    let x = "NoteBook";
                    console.log(x);
                    // y is an object

                    console.log(y);
 
                  /* Do not create Strings objects.
                        The new keyword complicates the code and slows down execution speed.
                        String objects can produce unexpected results:*/

                //Note: Comparing two JavaScript objects always returns false.
                //example
                let x1 = new String("Laptop");  // x1 is an object
                let y1 = new String("Laptop");  // y1 is an object
                console.log(x1==y1); // false

                // for ===
                let x2 = new String("Mobile");  // x2 is an object
                let y2 = new String("Mobile");  // y2 is an object
                console.log(x2===y2); // false

            /*  Extra : 
                The main difference between the == and === operator in javascript is that the == operator
                 does the type conversion of the operands before comparison, whereas the === operator
                 compares the values as well as the data types of the operands.
