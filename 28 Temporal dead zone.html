        from N.S video : let and const at 5:31  
        <strong>
            The let and const variables are not accessible before they are initialized with some value,
             and the phase between the starting of the execution of block in which the let or const
             variable is declared till that variable is being initialized is called 
             Temporal Dead Zone for the variable
             (time between hoisting and initializing with some value is known as TDZ)

             or 
             in simple words:
             Temporal dead zone : TDZ is the time since when this let and const variables has hoisted 
             and till it is initialized with some value.(the time between this is known as TDZ)
        </strong>
        <script>
            console.log(a); // TDZ started here and finishes when value is assigned to a i.e in line number 22

            let a=5;  //TDZ ends here
            var b=10;
            
            /*
            SO, that phase from hoisting till it gets/assigns with some value, this phase is known as TDZ
            and, Whenever you try to access a varibale inside a TDZ it gives a ReferenceError like this 
            "Cannot access 'a' before intialization ".
            You cannot access the varible when its in TDZ, you can access it when some value is asigned to it

            /* What is this ReferenceError: watch video at 7:51 :
            The ReferenceError object represents an error when a variable that doesn't exist (or hasn't yet been initialized) in the current scope is referenced.

            when you try to access any random varibale which is not in our program, we get ReferenceError : x is not defined

            let and const varibales will not be attached to the window object(global object ) they are maintained in the

             important things:

             What Does Syntax Error Mean?
                A syntax error in computer science is an error in the syntax of a coding or programming language,
                 entered by a programmer. Syntax errors are caught by a software program called a compiler,
                  and the programmer must fix them before the program is compiled and then run.

             What Does Type Error Mean?
                The TypeError object represents an error when an operation could not be performed, 
                typically (but not exclusively) when a value is not of the expected type.

                A TypeError may be thrown when:
                an operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that
                operator or function; 
                or
                when attempting to modify a value that cannot be changed;
                 or
                when attempting to use a value in an inappropriate way.
                            
            What Does ReferenceError Mean?
                When JS Engine trys to find out a specific variable inside a memory space and you cannot access it, then
                it gives a ReferenceError.

            What is the difference between a TypeError and ReferenceError?
                A ReferenceError occurs when you try to use a variable that doesn't exist at all.

                A TypeError occurs when the variable exists, but the operation you're trying to 
                perform is not appropriate for the type of value it contains.
