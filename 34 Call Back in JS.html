        A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function
        This technique allows a function to call another function
        A callback function can run after another function has finished

             Not in the sequence they are defined.
            This example will end up displaying "JavaScript": */
            function display(some){
                document.getElementById("TEXT").innerHTML=some;
            }
            function myFirst(){
                display("Hello");

                display("JavaScript");
            }
            myFirst(); // here It will display : Hello
            mysecond(); // but Value is now changed to : JavaScript
            // now if i call myFirst() here it will display Hello to the screen i.e they are executed in the
            // sequence they are called i.e //myFirst();

            /*Sometimes you would like to have better control over when to execute a function.

                Suppose you want to do a calculation, and then display the result.
                You could call a calculator function (myCalculator), save the result, 
                and then call another function (myDisplayer) to display the result:

                Example
                function myDisplayer(some) {
                  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = some;
                }

                function myCalculator(num1, num2) {
                  let sum = num1 + num2;
                  return sum;
                }

                let result = myCalculator(5, 5);
                myDisplayer(result);

                Or, you could call a calculator function (myCalculator), and
                 let the calculator function call the display function (myDisplayer):

                Example
                function myDisplayer(some) {
                  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = some;
                }

                function myCalculator(num1, num2) {
                  let sum = num1 + num2;
                  myDisplayer(sum);
                }

                myCalculator(5, 5);

                The problem with the first example above, is that you have to 
                call two functions to display the result.

                // The problem with the second example, is that you cannot prevent
                 the calculator function from displaying the result.*/

               //Now it is time to bring in a callback.
              /* JavaScript Callbacks
                A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.
                Using a callback, you could call the calculator function (myCalculator) with a callback,
                 and let the calculator function run the callback after the calculation is finished:*/
                
                 function result(some){
                    document.getElementById("SUM").innerHTML=some;
                 }
                 function calculator(num1, num2, callback){
                    let sum=num1+num2;
                    callback(sum); // in callback we have result function
                 }
                 calculator(6,7,result); // result function passed as argument to the calculator function

                 /* When you pass a function as an argument, remember not to use parenthesis.
                    Right: myCalculator(5, 5, myDisplayer);
                    Wrong: myCalculator(5, 5, myDisplayer()); */
           
        </script>
        <!-- When to Use a Callback?
        The examples above are not very exciting.
        
        They are simplified to teach you the callback syntax.
        
        Where callbacks really shine are in asynchronous functions, where one function has to wait for another function (like waiting for a file to load).       
        Asynchronous functions are covered in the next program. -->
