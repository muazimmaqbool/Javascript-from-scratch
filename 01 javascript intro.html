<!-- JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on 
    web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for 
    you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, 
    scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the 
    third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) 
    we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

    JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.

    JavaScript can be used in three different ways 1) inline 2) internal and 3)external

    What is scripting language with example?
JavaScript, Python, and Ruby are all examples of scripting languages. All scripting languages are programming languages, 
    but not all programming languages are scripting languages. 
    Scripting languages in essence, are a series of commands that are able to be executed without the need for compiling.
