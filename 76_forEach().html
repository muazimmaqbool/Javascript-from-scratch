    ->The forEach() method in JavaScript is used to execute a function once for each element in an array. 
      It's a cleaner and more readable alternative to the traditional for loop when you just want to perform an
      operation on each array element.

    ->Syntax:
        array.forEach(function(currentValue, index, arr){
            // code to be executed for each element
        })

        currentValue(required): The value of the current element being processed in the array.
        index (optional): The index of the current element being processed in the array.
        arr (optional): The array that forEach() is being applied to.

      //Example One:
      const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
      fruits.forEach((fruit) => {
        console.log(fruit);
      });

      //Example Two:
      const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
      numbers.forEach((num, index) => {
        console.log(`Index: ${index} & value: ${num}`);
      });

      //Example Three:
      const users = [
        { name: "Muazim", city:"Sopore", age: 25 },
        { name: "Ali", city:"Srinagar", age: 30 },
        { name: "Sara", city:"Kupwara", age: 22 },
      ];
      users.forEach((user) => {
        console.log(`User is ${user.name} and is from ${user.city}`);
      });
