    ->The forEach() method in JavaScript is used to execute a function once for each element in an array. 
      It's a cleaner and more readable alternative to the traditional for loop when you just want to perform an
      operation on each array element.

    ->Syntax:
        array.forEach(function(currentValue, index, arr){
            // code to be executed for each element
        })

        currentValue(required): The value of the current element being processed in the array.
        index (optional): The index of the current element being processed in the array.
        arr (optional): The array that forEach() is being applied to.
