        Functions running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous
                        A good example is JavaScript setTimeout().
        Asynchronous makes js different then other languages. Basically there are three different types of
        Asynchronous JS: 1)Callbacks 2)Promises 3)Async/Await(new feature of JS)

        Study from W3schools and NS

        In the real world, callbacks are most often used with asynchronous functions.
                A typical example is JavaScript setTimeout().


        important :
        By default, JavaScript is a synchronous, single threaded programming language.
         This means that instructions can only run one after another, and not in parallel.
          Consider the little code snippet below:
          let a = 1;
          let b = 2;
          let sum = a + b;
          console.log(sum);

          The above code is pretty simple â€“ it sums two numbers and then logs the sum to the browser 
          console. The interpreter executes these instructions one after another in that order until it
          is done.
        But this method comes along with disadvantages. Say we wanted to fetch some large amount of 
        data from a database and then display it on our interface. When the interpreter reaches the 
        instruction that fetches this data, the rest of the code is blocked from executing until the
         data has been fetched and returned.
        Now you might say that the data to be fetched isn't that large and it won't take any noticeable
        time. Imagine that you have to fetch data are at multiple different points. This delay compounded
        doesn't sound like something users would want to come across.
        Luckily for us, the problems with synchronous JavaScript were addressed by introducing 
        asynchronous JavaScript.
        Think of asynchronous code as code that can start now, and finish its execution later. 
        When JavaScript is running asynchronously, the instructions are not necessarily executed
         one after the other as we saw before.

            }

            // Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially 
            // long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs,
            // rather than having to wait until that task has finished. Once that task has finished, 
            // your program is presented with the result.
