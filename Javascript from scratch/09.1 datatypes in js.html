        JavaScript has 8 Datatypes            The Object Datatype
            1. String                            The object data type can contain:
            2. Number                            1. An object
            3. Bigint                            2. An array
            4. Boolean                           3. A date
            5. Undefined
            6. Null
            7. Symbol
            8. Object

    <script>
        // Numbers:
        let length = 16;
        let weight = 7.5;
        console.log(length,"and",weight);

        // Strings:
        let color = "Yellow";
        let lastName = "Johnson";
        console.log(color);

        // Booleans:
        let x = true;
        let y = false;
        console.log(x);

        // Object:
        const person = {firstName:"Muazim", lastName:"Maqbool"};
        console.log("object:",person)

        // Array:
        const cars = ["Honda", "Volvo", "BMW"];
        console.log("array:",cars)
        
        // Date object:
        const date = new Date(); // will give current date and time
        console.log("current date and time:",date)
        const time=date.toLocaleTimeString(); //will give current local time
        //or
        //const time=new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
        console.log("current local time:",time);

        //Note:
        let result= 16 + "laptop"; 
        //JavaScript will treat the example above as: let result="16" + "laptop";
        //When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.
        //That's because + is also used for string concatenation in JavaScript â€” so if either operand is a string, it treats it like a string concat.
        console.log(result) // o/p: 16laptop
        //same goes with : let result="laptop" + 16 ; o/p: laptop16

        //Important: //when you do like this 16-"8" here o/p: is 8
        let result1= 16 - "8"; 
        //JavaScript will treat the example above as: let result1=16-8;
        console.log("result1:",result1) // o/p: 8
        /*
        In javascript, the - operator forces numeric conversion on both operands if at least one is not a number
        ->Here 16 is a number and "8" is a string, so "8" will be converted to a number.because - is a mathematical operator, 
        and it expects numbers.

        ->This is known as type coercion (process of converting a value from one type to another).
         Other concepts:
            -Implicit Coercion = JS does it for you (without asking).
            -Explicit Coercion = You do it manually using functions like Number(), String(), etc.
        */

        //Note:
        //JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different 
        //results:
        let output=16+4+ "Desktop";
        console.log(output); // o/p: 20Desktop
        //JavaScript treats 16 and 4 as numbers, until it reaches "Desktop" , then result of previous truns to string

        //Note!
        let output1="Desktop"+ 16+4;
        console.log(output1); // o/p: Desktop164
        //since the first operand is a string, then all operands are treated as strings.

        //JavaScript Types are Dynamic
        //JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different 
        //data types:
        let a;         // here a is undefined
        a = 5;         // Now a is a Number
        a = "printer";    // Now a is a String
        console.log(a); // o/p: printer

        //JavaScript BigInt
        //All JavaScript numbers are stored in a a 64-bit floating-point format.
        //JavaScript BigInt is a new datatype (2020) that can be used to store integer values that 
        //are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.
        let b = BigInt("123456789012345678901234567890");
        console.log(b);

        //JavaScript Objects - important
        //JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.
        //Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.
        //Objects are used to store named values
        const item={
            name:"Hp laptop",
            model:"2018",
            ram:"8GB",
            processor:"i3"
        }
        console.log(item);
        //The object (item) in the example above has 4 properties: name,model,ram,processor
        console.log("the product is: "+item.name+" it has "+item.ram); // or use , in place of +

        //The typeof Operator:
        //You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable.
        //The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression:
        console.log(typeof(""));
        console.log(typeof("laptop"));
        console.log(typeof "mobile phone");
        console.log(typeof 0);
        console.log(typeof 12);
        console.log(typeof 3.14);
        let z=true;
        console.log(typeof z);//boolean
