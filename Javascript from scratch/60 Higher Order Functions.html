      //higher order function:
      /*
        -> Basically, a function which takes another function as an argument or returns a function or does both
           is known as a higher order function.
        -> Higher order functions are:
            - In JavaScript functions, map, filter and reduce are examples of built-in higher-order functions they are studied before
            - setInterval and setTimeout are also the higher order functions in Javascript.
              they are also covered before 
            - find() / some() / every() / forEach() / sort() / reverse() / splice() / slice() / concat() / join() / push() / 
              pop() / shift() / unshift() are also higher order functions.
        */

      function multiplier(num){
        return (x)=>{
            return x*num
        }

      //the double is a function returned from the multiplier function
