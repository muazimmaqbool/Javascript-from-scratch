      //A class created with a class is called inheritance and it inherits all the methods from another class:
      //basically inheritance is creating a class from another class.
      //To create a class inheritance, use the extends keyword.

      //Create a class named "Model;" which will inherit the methods from the "Car" class:

      //parent class
      class Car {
        constructor(brand) {
          this.carname = brand;
        }
        present() {
          return "I have a " + this.carname;
        }
      }
      //child class
      class Model extends Car {
        constructor(brand, mod) {
          super(brand); //refers to parent
          this.model = mod;
        }
        show() {
          return this.present() + ", it is a " + this.model;
        }
      }
      let myCar = new Model("Ford", "Mustang");
      console.log(myCar);
      //Inheritance is useful for code reusability: reuse properties and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.
