/*
->Memoziation:
    Memoization is an optimization technique used to speed up function calls by caching the results of expensive function calls
    and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

    Implement a memoization function that takes a function as an argument and returns a memoized version of that function. 
    The memoized function should cache the results based on the arguments passed to it.

->What is Memoization (in simple words)?
    Memoization = "Don’t repeat expensive work if you already did it once."
    If a function is called again with the same inputs, return the stored result instead of recalculating.
