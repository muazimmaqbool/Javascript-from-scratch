            products.splice(1,1); // means it will delete item at 1 and just 1 item thats what 1,1 means so, here it removes CPU element
            console.log("after removing index 1: "+products);
            products.splice(0,2); // means delete from 0 and delete two items i.e 0 and 1 so, it will delete Camera and SmartPhone
            // it will delete two items staring from 0 index i.e 0 and 1 index
            console.log("products array updated: "+products);

            //splice can we used to add in items
            products.splice(1,0,"Mouse"); // means it will add Mouse just before the item at index 1

            products.splice(3,1,"Keyboard") // replacing display screen with Keyboard
            // we can add any items
            products.splice(0,1,"Printer","Scanner","MousePAD");//replacing item at index 0 with many itmes
            console.log("Items in products: "+products);

            //removing item from array using pop
            console.log("Pop()");

            console.log(products);
            console.log("Pop()");
            products.pop();// now removes Ups
            console.log(products);
           //console.log(products.pop()); //now removes mouse and returns mouse

            Why Use Arrays?
If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

let car1 = "Saab";
let car2 = "Volvo";
let car3 = "BMW";
However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?

The solution is an array!

An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.

Creating an Array
Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.

Syntax:

const array_name = [item1, item2, ...];
