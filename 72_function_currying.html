        What is Currying Function in JavaScript ?
        Currying is a functional programming technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed
        into a series of functions, each taking a single argument.Instead of taking all arguments at once,
        the curried function takes the first argument, returns a new function that takes the next argument,
        and so on until all arguments are provided. The final function then returns the result.

        In simpler terms, currying breaks down a function that takes multiple parameters into a chain of functions
        that each take one parameter.

    Note: An American mathematician named Haskell Curry developed this technique, that’s why it is called currying.   
          Although he didn’t invent it, currying is named in his honor due to his significant contributions to functional programming.

    //How Currying Works
    //Here’s how a regular function is translated into a curried function:

    // Regular function
    function simpleFunction(param1, param2, param3) {
      return param1 + param2 + param3;
    }
    console.log("regular function:",simpleFunction(5,6,7))
    // Curried function
    function curriedFunction(param1) {
      return function (param2) {
        return function (param3) {
          return param1 + param2 + param3;
        };
      };
    }
    console.log("curried function:",curriedFunction(5)(6)(7))
