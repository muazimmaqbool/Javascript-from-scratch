        What is Currying Function in JavaScript ?
        Currying is a functional programming technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed
        into a series of functions, each taking a single argument.Instead of taking all arguments at once,
        the curried function takes the first argument, returns a new function that takes the next argument,
        and so on until all arguments are provided. The final function then returns the result.

        In simpler terms, currying breaks down a function that takes multiple parameters into a chain of functions
        that each take one parameter.

    Note: An American mathematician named Haskell Curry developed this technique, that’s why it is called currying.   
          Although he didn’t invent it, currying is named in his honor due to his significant contributions to functional programming.

    //How Currying Works
    //Here’s how a regular function is translated into a curried function:

    // Regular function
    function simpleFunction(param1, param2, param3) {
      return param1 + param2 + param3;
    }
    console.log("regular function:", simpleFunction(5, 6, 7));
    // Curried function
    function curriedFunction(param1) {
      return function (param2) {
        return function (param3) {
          return param1 + param2 + param3;
        };
      };
    }
    console.log("curried function:", curriedFunction(5)(6)(7));

    /*
    Why is Currying useful in JavaScript?
        Currying offers several advantages, especially when working with functional programming patterns:

        It helps us to create a higher-order function
        It reduces the chances of error in our function by dividing it into multiple
               smaller functions that can handle one responsibility.
        It is very useful in building modular and reusable code
        It helps us to avoid passing the same variable multiple times
        It makes the code more readable

    //Calculating the Volume of a Cuboid Example:
    function calculateVolume(length){
      return function (breadth){
        return function (height){
          return length*breadth*height;
        }
      }
    }
    console.log("volume of cuboid:",calculateVolume(4)(5)(6))
