            var x=5; // global variable
            f1();
            f2();
            console.log(x);
            function f1(){
                var x=20;

            function f2(){
                var x=40;

<!-- Let's see how this works :
first js will create an execution context and assign memory to variable and functions
and this global execute context(GEC) will be pushed to call  stack
i.e :        memory             code                                             call stack:
              x: undefined                                                           
              f1:{...}                                                 
              f2:{...}                                                               GEC

    -> Now it will run the first line of code in the js i.e inside <script></script>
    i.e :        memory             code
              x: undefined         line 8: var x=5; // will replace x: undefined with x:5
              f1:{...}
              f2:{...}

             ********
              memory             code
              x: 5         line 8: var x=5; 
              f1:{...}
              f2:{...}

    -> now it will move to the next line of code to execute i.e line number 9.

              memory             code
              x: 5         line 8: var x=5; 
              f1:{...}         f1();    // here new execution context is created for the function and will 
                                    be pushed to call stack and control moves from line 9 to line 12
              f2:{...}                                call stack:
                                                        f1()
                                                        GEC
              i.e :
              memory             code
              x: 5             line 8: var x=5; 
              f1:{...}         f1();       memory           code  // here it will again do same process
              f2:{...}                     x:undefined       var x=20;           
                                           now x:20      
                                                             console.log(x); 
                                                             // it will look in the local memory of the execution context to find value of x and prints it in the console
                              // once this function finishes execution its execution context box is removed/deleted
                                       
                              console :  20      now, call stack:
                                                        GEC

//now control moves back to GEC and it will to next line from 9 to 10 . and also at line 10 same process is 
done new execution context box is created and added to call stack and the value of x=40 is printed to the console
and after the execution process its execution context box is deleted and control moves back to GEC
 and now it starts executing the next line i.e 11 and prints the value of x=5; and prints it to the 
 console and the whole code is executed
 and the whole execution context box is deleted i.e GEC .
 this is how the functions works inside js.
 and try this example in the system and try to see this in degubbing -->
