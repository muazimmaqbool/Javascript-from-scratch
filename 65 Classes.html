        /*
        ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, introduced JavaScript Classes.
        JavaScript Classes are templates for JavaScript Objects.

        ->JavaScript Class Syntax:
            Use the keyword class to create a class.
            Always add a method named constructor(){...}
                Syntax:
                    class ClassName {
                        constructor() { ... }
                    }
        */
       //example
       class car{ //class name car
        constructor(name,model){
            this.name=name;
            this.model=model;
        }
        //The class has two initial properties: "name" and "year".
       }
       //A JavaScript class is not an object. It is a template for JavaScript objects.

       //creating objects of class car
       const car1=new car("Ford",2019);
       const car2=new car("BMW",2023);
       //The constructor method is called automatically when a new object is created.
       console.log(car1.name);
       console.log(car2.name," and ",car2.model)

       /* important
       ->The Constructor Method
          The constructor method is a special method:
            It has to have the exact name "constructor"
            It is executed automatically when a new object is created
            It is used to initialize object properties
            If you do not define a constructor method, JavaScript will add an empty constructor method.
       */
      //we can have many class methods
      //example
      //add a method that returns bike age
      class bike{
        constructor(name,model){
            this.name=name;
            this.model=model;
        }
        //class methods
        bikeAge(){
            const date=new Date();
            return date.getFullYear() - this.model;
        }
        //You can send parameters to Class methods:
        bikeColor(color){
            console.log("Bike Color is: ",color)
        }
      }
      const myBike=new bike("BMW",2015);
      console.log(myBike.bikeAge());
      myBike.bikeColor("Blue and Gray");
