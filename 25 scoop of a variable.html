    <!-- 
    scope means: where you can access a varibale or a function in a code

    Variables have a global or local "scope". 
    For example, variables declared within either in the setup() or draw() functions may be only used in these functions. 
    Global variables, variables declared outside of setup() and draw(), may be used anywhere within the program.
    
      Scope: Global scoped or function scoped. The scope of the var keyword is the global or function 
      scope. It means variables defined outside the function can be accessed globally, and variables
       defined inside a particular function can be accessed within the function.

            //console.log(b); // o/p b is not defined//shows error as b is local variable/local scoped
