        <!--
        what is illegal shadowing?
        Ans: So, if we try to shadow let variable by var variable, 
             it is known as Illegal Shadowing and it will give the error as “variable is already defined.”
        -->

            //var a=10; //shadowing done easily by var also by let and const

            //let b=10; // error when try to shadow by var

            //const s=13; // error when try to shadow by var

            {
                //var b=15; // trying to shadow let, it  will be error : b has already been declared
                // and this is called illegal shadowing (let can't be redecalered)

                //let b=15; // now this is perfectly valid ,
                            // you can shadow a let using let but can't let by var
                
                //it behaves same in consts as well
                //var s=14; // error 's' has already been declared
                //const s=14 // no error
              
            }
            
            // lets see can we shadow var by let
            var b=5;
            {
                let b=6; // yes we can shadow var by let
                console.log("let b= "+b); //6
            } 
            console.log("var b= "+b); // 5   (important watch at 15:50)    
            
            //shadowing let by var in function
            console.log("var shadows let inside function:")
            let c=7;
            function x(){
                var c=8; // now it won't show any error because var is inside its boundries(var is now not interfering let)
                //and is not illegal-shadowing 
                console.log("var c= "+c); // 8
            }
            x();
            console.log("let c= "+c); //7
            // it behaves same in const

            const d=17;
            function y(){
                var d=18; // now it won't show any error because var is inside its boundries(var is now not interfering const)
                //and is not illegal-shadowing (var is a function scope) 
                console.log("var d= "+d); // 18
            }
            y();
            console.log("const d= "+d); //17

            // important : All the scope rules that applied on functions are same with Arrow Functions as well
            // Arrow functions studied in next program 27.4
