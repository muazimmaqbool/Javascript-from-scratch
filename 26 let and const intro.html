        var variables can be re-declared and updated
        This means that we can do this within the same scope and won't get an error:
        var greeting = "hey hi";
        var greeting = "say Hello instead";

        Let:
           let is now preferred for variable declaration. 
           It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. 

           "let is block scoped"
            A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. 
            Anything within curly braces is a block.
         So a variable declared in a block with let  is only available for use within that block. 

         "let can be updated but not re-declared."
         Just like var,  a variable declared with let can be updated within its scope. Unlike var,
          a let variable cannot be re-declared within its scope. 
          
          So while this will work:
            let greeting = "say Hi";
            greeting = "say Hello instead"; // greeting updated but not re-declared


           this will return an error:
              let greeting = "say Hi";
              let greeting = "say Hello instead"; 
               // error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared

            Hoisting of let
            Just like  var, let declarations are hoisted to the top. 
            Unlike var which is initialized as undefined, the let keyword is not initialized. 
            So if you try to use a let variable before declaration, you'll get a Reference Error.


            const:
            Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. 
            const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.

            "const declarations are block scoped"
           Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within
            the block they were declared.

            "const cannot be updated neither re-declared"
            This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope.
            It cannot be updated or re-declared.
             So if we declare a variable with const, we can't update or re-declared it:
              const greeting = "say Hi";
              greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Assignment to constant variable.

              const greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared
            
              "Every const declaration, therefore, must be initialized at the time of declaration."

              This behavior is somehow different when it comes to objects declared with const.
               While a const object cannot be updated, the properties of this objects can be updated. 
               Therefore, if we declare a const object as this:

                    const greeting = {
                        message: "say Hi",
                        times: 4
                    }

                    while we cannot do this:
                    greeting = {
                        words: "Hello",
                        number: "five"
                    } // error:  Assignment to constant variable.

                    we can do this:
                    greeting.message = "say Hello instead";
                    This will update the value of greeting.message without returning errors.

                    Hoisting of const
                    Just like let, const declarations are hoisted to the top but are not initialized.

                -> So just in case you missed the differences, here they are:

                    var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are 
                    block scoped.
                    
                    var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables
                    can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
                    
                    They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var 
                    variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
                    
                    While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be 
                    initialized during declaration.
