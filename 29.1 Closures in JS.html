            // closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.
            //In JS, a closure is created every time a function is created at function creation time
            function x(){
                var a=10;
                function y(){
                    console.log(a); // o/p 10 and this is what closure is
                // closure basically means that a function bind/group together with its lexical environment (parent)
                // or function along with its lexical scope forms a "closure" thats known as closure

                // here Inside y() function, it forms a closure with the varibale 'a' which is the part of x()
                // lexical scope/function and it has access to its parents lexical scope that's why it prints 10
                
                // watch at 3:56 about functions (very very important)

                // now study from next code 29.2 closures in JS
            
                }
                y();
            }
            x();

            // returing function at:6:00
            function test(){
                var x=20;
                function b(){
                    console.log(x); 
                }
                return b; //this will return whole function b()
            }
            var c=test();
            console.log(c); // o/p function b()'s code
